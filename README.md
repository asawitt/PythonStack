# PythonStack
Python Stack Data-Structure for HackerRank Challenges

## Installation
-Just use a standard List in python, unless you intend to edit this

-Fastest would be to copy-paste the contents of Stack.py into your code 

-Or you could download Stack.py and throw it in your project directory. Use "from DisjointSet import *" to use it in your code

-You could clone https://github.com/asawitt/PythonStack/ , move PythonStack.py to your project directory, then use the above import statement if you really want to. Don't. 

## Usage
### Create a new Stack
s = Stack()
### Add a value to the Stack O(1)
s.push(value)
### Peek O(1)
-Returns the value at the top of the Stack, None if empty

s.peek()
### Pop(1)
-Removes the item at the top of the stack and returns the value

s.pop()

### Display the Stack:
s.display()

### Getting the size O(1)
-Returns the number of elements in the Stack

q.getSize()

### Check if the Stack is empty O(1)
-Returns True if the Stack is empty, False otherwise

s.isEmpty()
